To run this project, make sure you have nodejs installed.

Steps:
`yarn install`
`yarn run dev`

Tips: every time we run yarn run dev, the migrations are updated, if you dont need it, use the command `yarn run dev-without-knex`

Test:
To be able to test it use a rest client like postman, insomnia and import the file `rest-client-config.json`. There you will find the requests and example os objects.
